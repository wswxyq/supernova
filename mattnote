I am generating new CSV files where each hit is labeled with its slice
or cluster, as we discussed last time. It is, unfortunately, much more
awkward to do than I originally thought, and the way I have implemented
it is horribly slow. As it is, the first file will be ready in about 3
days.

Possibly I could speed the code up, but I'm not sure that this will get
you the file sooner (i.e. programmer time [wall clock, given my other
responsibilities] + run time might be the same or longer).

Also, I will provide a partial file which might be enough for you to
start developing your end. It will appear in the Google Drive as:

fd-1kpc-9.6sm-0-overlaid.csv_v2-PARTIAL.csv.xz

I have to compress it, download it to my laptop, then upload it to
Google :eye-rolling-emoji:, so it will take a few tens of minutes
before it's there.

The new file format is the same as the old, but with an additional
column. It is an integer with these meanings:

Negative: Supernova-like cluster number -n, where the first cluster is
numbered 1.

Zero: Not in either a slice or cluster. This usually happens because
the hit is completely isolated; I don't form 1-hit clusters. It can
also happen if the cluster wanted to be larger than 7 hits, or if the
hit is very high ADC, or if the hit is in the very beginning or end of
the 5.005ms block that overlaps with the adjacent block.

Positive: Slice number n, where the first slice is numbered 1.

As a reminder, a "slice" and a "cluster" are really the same thing.
Both of them are just bags of hits, exclusive of hits in other slices
or clusters. "Slices" are formed by one algorithm, and "clusters" by
another which starts with the set of hits that weren't put in any
slice.
